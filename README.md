_TechTrends_ is an online website used as a news sharing platform, that enables consumers to access the latest news within the cloud-native ecosystem. In addition to accessing the available articles, readers are able to create new media articles and share them.

The web application is written using the `Python Flask framework`. It uses `SQLite`, a lightweight disk-based database to store the submitted articles.

The main components of the prototype of the application are:

I assumed the role of a platform engineer, to _package_ and _deploy_ TechTrends to _Kubernetes_ using a CI/CD pipeline.
